# Unsigned gMaps MIDlet

The gMaps MIDlet from 2008 still works on the new Nokia 3310 3G, but the CA is unknown so it won't install. This project provides an unsigned JAD file and sets an appropriately sized icon.

Here are the files: [JAD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/woodie/gmaps/master/dist/gMapsUnsigned.jad), [JAR](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/woodie/gmaps/master/dist/gMapsUnsigned.jar)
